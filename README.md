# Machine Problem: 2-3 Tree Visualizer
This project is a 2-3 Tree Visualizer made for our requirement in the course Design and Analysis of Algorithms. This was made by the collective effort of 4 students.

### About the Code
The code utilizes the algorithm for your basic 2-3 Tree. This includes insertion, deletion, and searching of node values.
There's nothing special about the algorithm, but that's because it's your simple binary tree that balances itself without manually doing it yourself, which is the concept of a 2-3 Tree.

### GUI
The UI was made to be simple and basic, the inspiration comes from your basic chalkboard. This is made by Carl Ola. I specifically requested it to be not that hard to implement in a program, since us 4, are still very inexperienced at this point in time when it comes to programming.
